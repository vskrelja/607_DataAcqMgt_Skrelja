(1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above.
You're encouraged to use a "wide" structure similar to how the information appears above, so
that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
(2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and
transform your data.
(3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.
(4) Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative
descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions.

```{r}
require(tidyr)
require(dplyr)

x <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vskrelja/607_DataAcqMgt_Skrelja/master/ALASKA_AMWEST.csv")  # read .csv file

x[1:3,1]<-'ALASKA'   # assign name to cases
x[4:6,1]<-'AM WEST'  # assign name to cases

names(x)[names(x) == "X"] <- "Airline"   # assign name to column
names(x)[names(x) == "X.1"] <- "Status"  # assign name to column

x <- x[complete.cases(x),]    # assign complete cases to x -- no missing values

x <- x %>% gather(key, value, Los.Angeles:Seattle)   # set key, value, cols to gather

x <- spread(x, "Status", "value")   # separates status column using value column

x <- mutate(x , total = (x$delayed + x$'on time'), pct_delayed = 100*x$delayed/total) # adds calcuted column

x <- arrange(x,-pct_delayed) # sorts by pct_delayed descending
x

summarise(group_by(x,Airline),Weighted_Delay_by_Airline=sum(delayed)/sum(total)) # computes weighted average delay by airline
```
